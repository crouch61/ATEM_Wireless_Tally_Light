ATEM Wireless Tally Light
=========================

Wireless tally light system for ATEM switchers.

Setup and Configuration
-----------------------

Note: We're assuming that you have a transmitter board with the Arduino Ethernet and also a receiver board with a JeeNode. If not, get them on our website.

-  Copy the dependent libraries from the project's libraries directory to your systems Arduino libraries directory. You may need to overwrite some of the libraries.
-  Upload `ATEM_Tally_Receiver.ino` to your receiver node.
-  Upload `ATEM_Tally_Transmitter.ino` to your transmitter.
-  Connect the transmitter to the same network as the ATEM switcher and power it on (it may take a minute to connect to ATEM).
-  Set the node # on your receiver using the DIP pins. It will blink the node # on power-on.

Once connected, the receiver will light up RED if on program and GREEN if on preview.

Transmitter
-----------

== Default Settings

  IP address	: 192.168.1.234
  Mac address 	: DE:AD:BE:EF:FE:ED
  Switcher IP	: 192.168.1.240
  Switcher PORT	: 49910

The settings can be modified using the web interface (by visiting the transmitter's IP) or reset using the RESET button on the transmitter.

== LED States

The following are transmitter LED states:

  RED 		: Not connected to network (or ATEM switcher)
  BLUE 		: Connected to ATEM switcher
  RED BLINK	: Radio signal sent

Receiver
--------

== LED States

The following are receiver LED states:

  POWER-ON BLUE BLINK	: Blinks node # or rapidly for test mode
  CONSTANT BLUE BLINK	: In test mode (receiving radio signal)
  RED					: Node # is on PROGRAM
  GREEN					: Node # is on PREVIEW

== Test Mode

Setting the receiver's node # to 0 (all DIP pins off) will switch it to _test mode_. When in _test mode_ the receiver will blink BLUE every 1 second if it's receiving a radio signal. On power-on in _test mode_ the LED will blink BLUE rapidly for a second or so.

== Node DIP Pins

The node DIP pins are binary-based. For example, when the DIP pins are `0110`, the node # is `5`.

Note: The receiver needs to be restarted whenever the node # is changed.

Library Modifications
---------------------

The RF12 library was slightly modified to allow the Arduino Ethernet to support both the Ethernet and the RF12 radio. Since Ethernet and the radio both use the same `SS_BIT`, they will conflict with each other. Leave Ethernet as it is and modify the RF12 library only. 

Note: There is a new class called `RF12Mod` which is a copy of `RF12` with slight modifications.
